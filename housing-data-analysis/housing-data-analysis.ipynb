    "Features:\n",
    "Hereâ€™s an explanation of each feature in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "MedInc (Median Income):\n",
    "Description: This feature represents the median income (in thousands of dollars) of the residents in a block group.\n",
    "Range: Typically ranges from $1,000 to over $10,000 (in thousands of dollars).\n",
    "Impact on Target: Higher income levels in an area often correlate with higher house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "HouseAge (Median House Age):\n",
    "Description: This feature represents the median age of houses in the block group.\n",
    "Range: Values range from 1 year to over 50 years, with many houses being several decades old.\n",
    "Impact on Target: Older houses might have lower value, although new houses can also have higher prices based on amenities, area, and development status.\n",
    "\n",
    "AveRooms (Average Number of Rooms per Household):\n",
    "Description: This feature represents the average number of rooms per household in the block group.\n",
    "Range: The average can range from 3 to 7 or more, depending on the neighborhood.\n",
    "Impact on Target: More rooms typically suggest larger homes, which often correlate with higher home values.\n",
    "\n",
    "AveOccup (Average Number of Occupants per Household):\n",
    "Description: This feature represents the average number of people living in each household in the block group.\n",
    "Range: The average number of people per household can range from 2 to 6.\n",
    "Impact on Target: Higher occupancy rates may suggest more crowded or less affluent neighborhoods, which could correlate with lower home prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latitude:\n",
    "Description: The latitude of the block group, representing the north-south position in California.\n",
    "Range: Typically ranges from around 32.5 to 37.5 degrees.\n",
    "Impact on Target: Latitude correlates with geographical location, which can impact prices. Coastal areas or areas near major cities tend to have higher home prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longitude:\n",
    "Description: The longitude of the block group, representing the east-west position in California.\n",
    "Range: Typically ranges from around -124.5 to -113.5 degrees.\n",
    "Impact on Target: Like latitude, longitude helps to position the block group geographically. Proximity to the coast or urban centers may increase home prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population:\n",
    "Description: The total population of the block group.\n",
    "Range: Varies widely based on block group, with values ranging from hundreds to thousands.\n",
    "Impact on Target: Larger populations may indicate urbanized areas, which could correlate with higher demand for housing and thus higher house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Households:\n",
    "Description: The total number of households in the block group.\n",
    "Range: Varies based on the block group size and population density.\n",
    "Impact on Target: More households may indicate a more developed or densely populated area, which could have higher house prices."

    "The relationship between features and the target variable (house price) can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "MedInc (Median Income): A higher median income usually correlates with higher house prices, as wealthier residents tend to live in more expensive areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "HouseAge (Median House Age): Older houses typically have lower values, but well-maintained or renovated houses in older neighborhoods may not follow this trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "AveRooms (Average Number of Rooms): More rooms generally correlate with larger houses, which are more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "AveOccup (Average Number of Occupants): Larger households (more occupants) may correlate with lower-priced homes, as overcrowded areas may not be as desirable for wealthier buyers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Latitude and Longitude: The geographical location is a major determinant of house prices. Coastal areas or those closer to cities like Los Angeles or San Francisco tend to have higher house prices, while areas further inland tend to have lower prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Population and Households: Areas with higher populations or more households may be urbanized or densely populated, which can lead to higher demand for housing and, consequently, higher prices."

    "Now let's interpret the summary statistics in the context of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1. MedInc (Median Income)\n",
    "Mean: The average income across all block groups is $3,870 (in thousands of dollars).\n",
    "Range: The minimum value is $500, while the maximum value is $15,000. This large spread indicates significant income inequality across regions in California.\n",
    "Quartiles: The 25th percentile (Q1) is $2,560, indicating that 25% of the areas have a median income lower than this, while the 75th percentile (Q3) is $4,960, meaning that 75% of the areas have a median income lower than this.\n",
    "Interpretation: Higher median incomes tend to correlate with higher property values, and this feature has a wide range, which reflects the economic diversity across California.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.2. HouseAge (Median House Age)\n",
    "Mean: The average house age is 28.64 years.\n",
    "Range: The house age spans from 1 year to 52 years, indicating that the dataset includes both newly developed and older residential areas.\n",
    "Quartiles: The 25th percentile (Q1) is 19 years, and the 75th percentile (Q3) is 41 years.\n",
    "Interpretation: Most houses in the dataset are quite old, with the median house age indicating that California's housing stock is generally mature. The correlation with house prices is typically negative â€” older homes tend to have lower prices, though other factors, such as location, can also influence this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.3. AveRooms (Average Number of Rooms per Household)\n",
    "Mean: The average number of rooms per household is 5.44.\n",
    "Range: The number of rooms varies from 3 rooms to 9.6 rooms per household, indicating the presence of both smaller homes and larger properties.\n",
    "Quartiles: The 25th percentile (Q1) is 4.3 rooms, and the 75th percentile (Q3) is 6.6 rooms.\n",
    "Interpretation: Larger homes, as indicated by the number of rooms, are more likely to be in higher-value areas. Larger houses typically lead to higher housing prices, which is expected in wealthier areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.4. AveOccup (Average Number of Occupants per Household)\n",
    "Mean: The average number of occupants per household is 3.07.\n",
    "Range: The number of occupants ranges from 1 to 6.6.\n",
    "Quartiles: The 25th percentile (Q1) is 2.16 occupants, and the 75th percentile (Q3) is 3.48 occupants.\n",
    "Interpretation: A lower average number of occupants per household is typically found in more affluent areas, where families may have fewer members and more living space, contributing to higher house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.5. Latitude and Longitude\n",
    "Latitude: The dataset ranges from 32.54 to 37.99 degrees latitude, primarily covering the central and northern parts of California.\n",
    "Longitude: The dataset ranges from -124.55 to -113.47 degrees longitude, which also reflects areas in California with proximity to major urban centers and the Pacific coastline.\n",
    "Interpretation: Latitude and longitude significantly impact house prices, with coastal and urban areas tending to have higher prices due to demand for housing in those regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6. Population and Households\n",
    "Population: The population in each block group ranges from 3 to 35,682.\n",
    "Households: The number of households ranges from 1 to 6,082.\n",
    "Interpretation: A larger population and a higher number of households suggest more densely populated areas, which tend to have higher housing demand. Larger cities with higher populations often have higher median house values due to demand and limited housing availability."
