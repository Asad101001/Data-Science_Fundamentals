Regression Practice Questions
1. Electricity Bill Prediction
o Question: Predict the electricity bill amount based on household size, daily usage hours, and the number of appliances.
o Model: Linear Regression or ANN with one output neuron.
o Evaluation: Use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or R² score.
2. Temperature Forecasting
o Question: Predict the temperature based on the day of the year and rainfall.
o Model: Polynomial Regression or ANN.
o Hint: Since weather patterns can be slightly non-linear, a deeper network might improve performance.
Classification Practice Questions
3. Loan Approval Prediction
o Question: Classify whether a loan application will be approved based on income and credit score.
o Model: Logistic Regression, Random forest classifier, or ANN with a sigmoid activation function in the output layer.
o Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Storm Prediction
o Question: Predict whether there will be a storm based on rainfall and storm probability.
o Model: Random Forest or ANN.
o Tip: Normalize features for better ANN performance.
Clustering Practice Questions
5. Customer Segmentation
o Question: Group customers based on annual income, spending score, and age to identify different customer types.
o Model: K-Means Clustering 
o Challenge: Visualize clusters and interpret their significance.
6. Weather Condition Clustering
o Question: Cluster weather data into different patterns based on temperature, rainfall, and storm probability.
o Model: K-Means 
o Evaluation: Use precision score to evaluate clustering quality.

ANN Practice Questions
9. Predicting Electricity Bill
o Question: Build an ANN with three input neurons (household size, daily usage hours, number of appliances) and one output neuron to predict electricity bills.
o Layers: Use 2 hidden layers with ReLU activation.
o Output Layer: Use a linear activation function for regression.
10. Classifying Loan Approval
* Question: Design an ANN to predict loan approval. Use two hidden layers.
* Input Features: Income and credit score.
* Output Layer: Use a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
12. Weather Condition Classification
* Question: Predict if the weather condition is “Stormy” or “Clear” based on temperature, rainfall, and storm probability.
* Model: Use an ANN with 3 inputs and one output for binary classification.
